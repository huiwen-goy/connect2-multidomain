#### About this project
 
The goals of this project were to: a) get a more holistic view of the types of health issues that older adults with hearing loss have to deal with, in addition to dealing with hearing loss, and b) to compare the health of people with hearing loss to that of people with normal hearing.
 
#### About the data
 
There were 500+ survey responses recorded on Qualtrics. After filtering according to certain criteria, 400+ responses were analyzed. 
 
#### About the code
 
The Rmd file contains code for: cleaning the raw dataset from Qualtrics; merging survey responses with clinic measurements; creating scored variables from individual questionnaire items; visualizations for variables of interest, and some statistical analyses looking at group differences and associations between health disorders.
