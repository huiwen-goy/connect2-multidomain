#### About this project

The goals of this project were to: 
1) Understand what types of health issues older adults with hearing loss experience, in the domains of hearing, cognitive health, physical health, mobility, psychological health, and social well-being  
2) Compare the health issues reported by people with hearing loss to the health issues reported by people with normal hearing
