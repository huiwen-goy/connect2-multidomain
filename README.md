The Rmd file contains the code for merging Qualtrics and Connect data, and the code for creating new variables.

Note that there hasn't been any "cleaning" of variables yet. Most variables do not need cleaning, because there was a closed set of responses in Qualtrics. However, any fields that allowed participants to type in their answer (e.g., year of birth) do need to be checked.
