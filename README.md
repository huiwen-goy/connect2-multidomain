#### About this project
 
The goals of this project were to: a) understand what types of health issues older adults with hearing loss have to deal with, in addition to dealing with hearing loss, and b) to compare the health of people with hearing loss to the health of people with normal hearing.
 
#### About the data
 
There were 553 survey responses recorded on Qualtrics. After filtering out participants who declined to participate, only including participants with audiometric data, and only including participants who had less than 10% of responses missing, 427 responses were analyzed. 
 
#### About the code
 
The Rmd file contains code for: cleaning the raw dataset from Qualtrics; merging survey responses with clinic measurements; creating scored variables from individual questionnaire items; visualizations for variables of interest, and some statistical analyses looking at group differences and associations between health disorders.
